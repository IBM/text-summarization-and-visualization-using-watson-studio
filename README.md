# Text summarization and visualization using watson studio

We will demonstrate a methodology to summarize & visualize text using Watson Studio. Text summarization is the process of creating a short and coherent version of a longer document. There are two methods to summarize the text, extractive & abstractive summarization. We will focus on extractive summarization which involves the selection of phrases and sentences from the source document to make up the new summary. Techniques involve ranking the relevance of phrases in order to choose only those most relevant to the meaning of the source. Some of the advantages of text summarization are below. We will also demonstrate different methods to visualize the data which can aid in providing quick peek of the data.

`Summaries reduce reading time. When researching documents, summaries make the selection process easier.Text summarization improves the effectiveness of indexing.Text summarization algorithms are less biased than human summarizers.
Personalized summaries are useful in question-answering systems as they provide personalized information.Using automatic or semi-automatic summarization systems enables commercial abstract services to increase the number of texts they are able to process.`

[A Brief about Text Summarization](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-text-summarization)

When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

* Quickly summarize the text from documents & news feeds.
* Create topic modeling on the text to extract important topics.
* Create visualizations for better understanding of the data.
* Interpret the summary and visualization of the data.
* Analyze the text for further processing to generate recommendations or taking informed decisions.

## 1. Create an account with IBM Cloud

Sign up for IBM [**Cloud**](https://console.bluemix.net/). By clicking on create a free account you will get 30 days trial account.

## 2. Create a new Watson Studio project

Sign up for IBM's [Watson Studio](http://dataplatform.ibm.com/). 

Click on `New project` and select `Data Science` as per below.

![](https://github.com/IBM/text-summarization-and-visualization-using-watson-studio/blob/master/doc/source/images/new_project.png)

Define the project by giving a Name and hit `Create`.

![](https://github.com/IBM/text-summarization-and-visualization-using-watson-studio/blob/master/doc/source/images/define_project.png)

By creating a project in Watson Studio a free tier ``Object Storage`` service will be created in your IBM Cloud account.

## 3. Create the notebook

* Open [IBM Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.ibm.com).
* Click on `Create notebook` to create a notebook.
* Select the `From URL` tab.
* Enter a name for the notebook.
* Optionally, enter a description for the notebook.
* Enter this Notebook URL: https://github.com/IBM/text-summarization-and-visualization-using-watson-studio/blob/master/notebook/Text_Summarize_and_Visualize.ipynb
* Select the runtime (1vCPU and 4GBRAM)
* Click the `Create` button.

## 4. Add the data

[Clone this repo](https://github.com/IBM/text-summarization-and-visualization-using-watson-studio)
Navigate to [data](https://github.com/IBM/text-summarization-and-visualization-using-watson-studio/tree/master/data) and save the file on the disk. The data has been extracted from one of the movie review websites online.

Use `Find and Add Data` (look for the `10/01` icon)
and its `Files` tab. From there you can click
`browse` and add data file from your computer.

![](https://github.com/IBM/text-summarization-and-visualization-using-watson-studio/blob/master/doc/source/images/add_file.png)

Note: The data file is in the `data` directory

## 5. Insert the credentials

Select the cell below `Read the Data` section in the notebook.

Use `Find and Add Data` (look for the `10/01` icon) and its `Files` tab. You should see the file names uploaded earlier. Make sure your active cell is the empty one created earlier. Select `Insert to code` (below your file name). Click `Insert credentials` from the drop down menu.

## 6. Run the notebook

When a notebook is executed, what is actually happening is that each code cell in
the notebook is executed, in order, from top to bottom.

Each code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tag
format is `In [x]:`. Depending on the state of the notebook, the `x` can be:

* A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
* A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
* A `*`, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

There are several ways to execute the code cells in your notebook:

* One cell at a time.
  * Select the cell, and then press the `Play` button in the toolbar.
* Batch mode, in sequential order.
  * From the `Cell` menu bar, there are several options available. For example, you
    can `Run All` cells in your notebook, or you can `Run All Below`, that will
    start executing from the first cell under the currently selected cell, and then
    continue executing all cells that follow.
    
## 7. Analyze the results

Lets look at the summarization of the document. We can observe that all the key pointers are included in the summary. The text ranking algorithm has produced good results. 

`Before its release, Mission: Impossible Fallout has been known for two things: the fact that it\'s the first direct sequel in the series and THAT injury to Tom Cruise.Let\'s get the injury out of the way first.', "The shot is in the movie and it will make you wince because you know the context, but otherwise you don't really notice any difference as the stunt in question is just the latest in a long line of deathdefying activities featuring Cruise.What makes more of an impact on the sixth movie in the series is its connection to the previous movie, Rogue Nation, with the return of the villainous Solomon Lane (played creepily again by Sean Harris) and his nefarious Syndicate, who are again threatening the world.With the addition of Ethan Hunt's former wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) from the third movie, Fallout is immediately given more depth than previous outings and the stakes feel higher, with Ethan Hunt (Cruise) haunted by his past mistakes.", "At times, even IMAX doesn't feel big enough to contain it.Putting aside the direct connection to the previous movie and the series' first returning director in Christopher McQuarrie, it's pretty much business as usual for Ethan and the IMF.", "There's no possible way this can go wrong, right?What follows is the usual, winning Mission: Impossible mix of spy games, double \\x96 and triple \\x96 crosses, chases of all kinds and extended set pieces in various locations around the world.", "Of the newcomers, Henry Cavill has the biggest role and Fallout makes full use of his considerable frame with some muscular fights, while The Crown's Vanessa Kirby relishes her enigmatic White Widow role, even if she is underused.But you don't really come to a Mission: Impossible movie for the cast, you come for the action \\x96 and you will not be disappointed.`

As we can see in the below image, the important words in the corpus have been highlighted which will help in inference of the data. Wordclouds are beautifully insightful with pros and cons. Word clouds can allow you to share back results from research in a way that does not require an understanding of the technicalities. Some of the pros are below.
* It reveals the essential. 
* They delight and provide emotional connection. 
* They are fast & engaging. 
As observed, skilled interpretation is what provides the beautiful insights.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic model with interpretable topics. Topic modeling is one of the most popular NLP techniques with several real-world applications such as dimensionality reduction, text summarization, recommendation engine, etc. To visualize our topics in a 2-dimensional space we will use the pyLDAvis library. This visualization is interactive in nature and displays topics along with the most relevant words.

![](https://github.com/IBM/text-summarization-and-visualization-using-watson-studio/blob/master/doc/source/images/results_2.png)

As we can see from the topics, the data is referring to Mission Impossible Fallout movie. Skilled interpretation is needed to an extent for consuming the insights from the results.
